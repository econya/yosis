## Architectural "design" decisions and stuff to know

This project was hacked with a tight time budget and virtually no resources
(besides server space). It couldnt be made clean and lots of tradeoffs had to be
done.

### JavaScript

* Removed webpacker, replaced by sprockets.
* Use the `direct_upload` stuff from ActiveStorage as is (exception: we want to
  see the errors alert).

### SiteSettings

* Global Site Settings implemented by a crude [SiteSettings
  Model](app/model/site_settings). No seed or prepopulation, they are created on
  the fly in the controller. Tradeoffs made

## Resources and lessons learned

### Big file upload

* Using ActiveStorage and a local Disk Service poses interesting challenges
* The files to be uploaded will be rather big (videos), thus we want to have
  feedback
* Took the direct_upload stuff from ActiveStorage guide.
* Increased the `service_urls_expire_in` limit to prevent long lasting uploads
  to hit a 404 on the attachment URL.
